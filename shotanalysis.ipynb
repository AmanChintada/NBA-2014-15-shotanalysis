    "This dataset contains data about players shot statistics in the 2014-2015 season of the National Basketball Association (NBA). In this particular analysis, we will be studying the performance of players during what is commonly known as 'crunch time' in the game of basketball. Basketball is a very fast paced game, and the entire tide of the game can change within a two minute span. For this analysis, we will assume that the last two minutes of a game will be termed as 'crunch time', where players are under pressure to make shots, and prevent the other team from making shots at the same time.<br><br> \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to defining crunch time by only looking at the last two minutes of the game-clock, we will set a few more conditions:<br>\n",
    "1) A FINAL_MARGIN of 3: This means that at the end of the game, the difference between points for each team should be lesser than 3. This deontes a close game, highlighting the definition of 'crunch time'.<br>\n",
    "2) SHOT_RESULT = made: The player has to have made the shot<br>\n",
    "3) PERIOD > OR =4: The shot must be taken in the 4th, 5th, or 6th quarter (essentially at the end of the game<br>\n",
    "4) Game Clock < 120 seconds: There must be only 2 minutes or less left in the game.<br>\n",

    "    \n",

    "    1) 2-point offensive crunch time performance\n",
    "    2) 3-point offensive crunch time performance\n",
    "    3) Overall offensice crunch time performance (both 2 and 3-pt)\n",
